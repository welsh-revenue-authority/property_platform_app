        <p>
          The land and property data platform is for service delivery teams and 
          data analysts working in the Welsh public sector. Some information is also available
          as open data and can be used by anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't need to create an account to get started with our API. 
        </p>
        <p><a href="/api-docs">Start exploring the API now</a></p>
        <p>
          You will be asked to create an account to access some datasets where licensing restrictions apply.
          For some closed datasets, there will be additional verification steps for your account.
          Without an account, the API will return fake example data.
        </p>
